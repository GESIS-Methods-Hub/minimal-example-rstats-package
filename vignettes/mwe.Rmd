knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>"
)
```

This example illustrates the **required** metadata by [`andrew`](https://github.com/GESIS-Methods-Hub/andrew) for a tutorial written as [`pkgdown`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/) vignette, based on R Markdown[@xie2018r] which is an extension to Markdown[@markdown2004].

## Markdown {#sec-markdown}

::: {.callout-important}

[`andrew`](https://github.com/GESIS-Methods-Hub/andrew) uses [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) and [`pkgdown`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/) uses [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) to convert Markdown to HTML.

:::

Although footnotes are supported, the use of footnotes is discouraged[^1].

[^1]: Because of it makes navigation harder.

Math can be written using [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) and is render by [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/). Both inline, for example $x$, and standalone, for example $$x = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}\text{,}$$ is supported.

R Markdown does **not** support cross-references like @sec-markdown.

R Markdown supports code execution .

## Execution of R code

R code can be executed and the output can be included inline, for example `1 + 1` is equal to `r 1 + 1`, and standalone, for example

```{r}
a <- 1
b <- 1

a + b
```

Annotation of code blocks is also supported. For example,

```r
(3 %/% 2) != (3 %% 2) # <1>
```
1. `%%` calculates the remainder on integer division.

## Execution of R code from package

```{r setup}
library(mwe)
```

```{r}
hello()
```

## Creation of figure with R

```{r}
plot(runif(10, min=0, max=10), type='l')
```
