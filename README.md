[`vignettes/example.Rmd`](https://github.com/GESIS-Methods-Hub/minimal-example-rstats-package/blob/main/vignettes/example.Rmd) illustrates all **required** metadata used by [`andrew`](https://github.com/GESIS-Methods-Hub/andrew).

## Supported Features

[`andrew`](https://github.com/GESIS-Methods-Hub/andrew) uses [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) and [`pkgdown`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/) uses [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) to convert Markdown to HTML. Because Quarto and R Markdown are not 100% compatible, we provide a comparison of features in the next table.

## GitHub Actions

[`.github/workflows/pkgdown.yaml`](.github/workflows/pkgdown.yaml) is the [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) used to create the R package website with [`pkgdown`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/). Ensure that GitHub Pages' source in `Settings > Pages > Build and deployment` is `GitHub Actions`.
