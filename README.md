# Minimal Example of Tutorial as R package vignette

[`vignettes/example.Rmd`](vignettes/example.Rmd) shows all the required metadata used by [`methodshub`](https://github.com/GESIS-Methods-Hub/methodshub).

## GitHub Actions

[`.github/workflows/pkgdown.yaml`](.github/workflows/pkgdown.yaml) is the [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) used to create the R package website with [`pkgdown`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/). Ensure that GitHub Pages' source in `Settings > Pages > Build and deployment` is `GitHub Actions`.
